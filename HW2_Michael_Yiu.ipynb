    "Please write and submit the programs and data files below by the deadline: Friday, March 28, at 6:00pm Pacific time\n",
    "\n",
    "You must complete the assignments individually. If you have trouble completing the assignment, please let one of the teaching assistants (TAs) know, during the lab or their office hours. They will help and guide you, but they will not write code for you and no one else should :) !!!\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission will include several components. Submissions to HW2 will contain **3** files:\n",
    "* HW2_[YOUR FIRSTNAME]_[YOUR LASTNAME].ipynb (for all your code)\n",

    "### Country population data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python topics:** BeautifulSoup, requests, dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is about extracting relevant population data from a Wikipedia table into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the function __load_population_dict__ to load the content of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population into a dictionary,\n",
    "using the country as a key, and the tuple (population_count, population_percentage) as a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy\n",
    "* Use the _requests_ library to read the content of the data file on the internet.\n",
    "* Use the _BeautifulSoup_ library to first __parse__ the content you downloaded into a _soup_ object.\n",
    "* Use the _BeautifulSoup_ library to navigate the _soup_ object and extract the info you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips\n",
    "- One way to gain a quick overview if the content of an HTML webpage is to visit it in a browser (such as Chrome) and inspect the HTML code on that page through \"View Page Source\" or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that the HTML file contains several tables, of which only one is of interest to us; one way to find the correct table is to check its caption for tell-tale signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "FAQs: <br>\n",
    "Q. How to read/parse a website?  \n",
    "A. For that, as taught in class you would need to use libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I don't know html, what should I do?  \n",
    "A. No worries. For this lab, you only need to understand that html is another type of a language made up of tags. For example, it has heading info in the *head* tag, paragraph has *p* tag, and html links have *a* tag. So, using the tag, you can get the info you need!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How do I get the tag info?  \n",
    "A. When you get your BeautifulSoup object you can do something like object.find_all('tag') or object('tag') to get all 'tag' tags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What are tag attributes and how can I access that?  \n",
    "A. HTML attributes are special words used inside the tag to control the element's behaviour. One can access attributes using the *get* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I got the tag, but what I got seems cryptic. What now?  \n",
    "A. So, once you get the info from a particular tag, you get the whole html code inside that tag. If you want some particular information from that, you would need to call functions like _get_ and _get_text_ to get the information directly without messing with the html code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What if the number of `<td>` elements inside a `<tr>` varies from row to row?<br>\n",
    "A. This might be due to some `<td>` element being shared between multiple rows or for other reasons. To address this, you can include checks on the number of `<td>` elements inside a `<tr>` and/or use a `<td>` with a recognizable pattern (of its text, of an attribute, or of a sub-element) as a reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I am not sure how to use these functions. Help?  \n",
    "A. You can read from the official documentation and study the examples that we have been providing.\n",
    "* Documentation link: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ \n",
    "* Study the BeautifulSoup section in https://www.isi.edu/~ulf/teaching/python.html \n",
    "* Study the examples in week9-1_Requests.ipynb (Blackboard -> Lectures -> Notebook section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Feature: Use the .prettify() feature of BeautifulSoup. You'll get a better insight of what is that you are scrapping. See example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure you have _BeautifulSoup_ installed:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install bs4\n",
    "```"
