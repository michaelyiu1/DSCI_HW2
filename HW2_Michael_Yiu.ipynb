    "### Country population data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python topics:** BeautifulSoup, requests, dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is about extracting relevant population data from a Wikipedia table into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the function __load_population_dict__ to load the content of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population into a dictionary,\n",
    "using the country as a key, and the tuple (population_count, population_percentage) as a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy\n",
    "* Use the _requests_ library to read the content of the data file on the internet.\n",
    "* Use the _BeautifulSoup_ library to first __parse__ the content you downloaded into a _soup_ object.\n",
    "* Use the _BeautifulSoup_ library to navigate the _soup_ object and extract the info you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips\n",
    "- One way to gain a quick overview if the content of an HTML webpage is to visit it in a browser (such as Chrome) and inspect the HTML code on that page through \"View Page Source\" or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that the HTML file contains several tables, of which only one is of interest to us; one way to find the correct table is to check its caption for tell-tale signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "FAQs: <br>\n",
    "Q. How to read/parse a website?  \n",
    "A. For that, as taught in class you would need to use libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I don't know html, what should I do?  \n",
    "A. No worries. For this lab, you only need to understand that html is another type of a language made up of tags. For example, it has heading info in the *head* tag, paragraph has *p* tag, and html links have *a* tag. So, using the tag, you can get the info you need!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How do I get the tag info?  \n",
    "A. When you get your BeautifulSoup object you can do something like object.find_all('tag') or object('tag') to get all 'tag' tags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What are tag attributes and how can I access that?  \n",
    "A. HTML attributes are special words used inside the tag to control the element's behaviour. One can access attributes using the *get* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I got the tag, but what I got seems cryptic. What now?  \n",
    "A. So, once you get the info from a particular tag, you get the whole html code inside that tag. If you want some particular information from that, you would need to call functions like _get_ and _get_text_ to get the information directly without messing with the html code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. What if the number of `<td>` elements inside a `<tr>` varies from row to row?<br>\n",
    "A. This might be due to some `<td>` element being shared between multiple rows or for other reasons. To address this, you can include checks on the number of `<td>` elements inside a `<tr>` and/or use a `<td>` with a recognizable pattern (of its text, of an attribute, or of a sub-element) as a reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. I am not sure how to use these functions. Help?  \n",
    "A. You can read from the official documentation and study the examples that we have been providing.\n",
    "* Documentation link: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/ \n",
    "* Study the BeautifulSoup section in https://www.isi.edu/~ulf/teaching/python.html \n",
    "* Study the examples in week9-1_Requests.ipynb (Blackboard -> Lectures -> Notebook section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Feature: Use the .prettify() feature of BeautifulSoup. You'll get a better insight of what is that you are scrapping. See example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure you have _BeautifulSoup_ installed:\n",
